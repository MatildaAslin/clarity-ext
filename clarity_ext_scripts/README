Includes simple script files that can be used with clarity-ext. These scripts
are specific to the setup at the SNP&SEQ platform at Uppsala University but they
can serve as samples for other installations.

The idea is that these scripts, by extending different extension classes from
clarity_ext, have all boilerplate removed that has to do with interfacing with the
Clarity server. Furthermore, they are automatically set up for validation which
does not require access to the server.
